### The Work

[Project Navi](https://github.com/Project-Navi) provides navigation infrastructure for AI systems — the measurement frameworks and governance protocols that make coherent adaptation possible.

**The Four Pillars:**
- [**DSC**](https://www.projectnavi.ai/dsc/) — Differential Symbolic Calculus for measuring creative regimes
- [**WMC**](https://www.projectnavi.ai/wmc/) — World Model Capital for trust allocation in machine cognition
- [**REO**](https://www.projectnavi.ai/reo/) — Relational Emergent Ontology as philosophical foundation
- [**Schema Registry**](https://www.projectnavi.ai/schema/) — Versioned data models and canonical data contracts

**Enterprise:** [Navi Pro](https://www.projectnavi.ai/pro/) — Code intelligence and governance infrastructure

### Background

Published in *Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal* (APA, 2024) on peer workforce retention. Managed $600K+ in federal (BJA) and corporate (Elevance Health) grants. 10+ years leading cross-system behavioral health programs.

### Research Focus

- Trajectory-based alignment for AI safety
- Multi-stakeholder coordination measurement
- Real-time coherence tracking during system transformation
